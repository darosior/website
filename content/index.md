# About

I work on [Bitcoin](https://bitcoincore.org/) at [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/about). My
work has recently been focused around enhancing the robustness of the protocol and the security of
its implementations. I previously co-founded [Wizardsardine](https://wizardsardine.com), of which I
am still a shareholder. There i researched [Bitcoin
vaults](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/vaults/) and implemented
[Revault](https://wizardsardine.com/revault), a Bitcoin vault for multi-party custody. I also
maintained [Liana](https://wizardsardine.com/liana), a Bitcoin wallet aimed at reducing risks of
loss. Before that i co-founded [Bitcoin-Lyon](https://bitcoin-lyon.fr), a local Bitcoin broker in
Lyon, France. I also used to contribute to
[Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning).

I'm interested in information security, economics and politics.
