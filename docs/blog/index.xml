      <description>&lt;p&gt;It appears many have different perspectives on soft forks than i do. Recent events and private discussions prompted me&#xA;to share my thoughts on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s value proposition is to be censorship-resistant money (some like to say &amp;ldquo;decentralised&amp;rdquo;).&#xA;And so far it largely succeeded: 15 years after its inception it&amp;rsquo;s still possible for anyone with occasional&#xA;access to the internet to receive, store and send value globally through the Bitcoin network without having&#xA;to ask anyone for permission. This is remarkable, and it would be a great achievement if we can keep it this&#xA;way for another 15 years. There seems however to be &lt;a href=&#34;https://transactionfee.info/charts/fees-per-day-btc&#34;&gt;little demand&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;for using Bitcoin (at least, as a medium of exchange). Or maybe just everybody is using Lightning and channel closures&#xA;are a thing of the past. Some believe many would like to use Bitcoin but are simply unable to, and this seems to be one&#xA;motivation behind the recent soft fork excitement. Another common, presumptuous, explanation is that actually&#xA;a lot of people need Bitcoin, but &lt;em&gt;they don&amp;rsquo;t realise it&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s necessary for the western bitcoiner, well educated&#xA;in the Bitcoin cult, to come and coinsplain them why they need to accept Bitcoin in their heart despite them having&#xA;already made the choice it was not the best option for them. We should note however that a low usage of Bitcoin can be&#xA;viewed as a good thing: the contrary may imply large scale economic repression is happening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
